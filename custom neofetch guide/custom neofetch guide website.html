    <h1>how to change your neofetch to the custom ascii art of your liking!</h1>
        <img src="./amonguspc.png" alt="">
<div>
    <p>Susrprisingly,this is actually not that hard to do.</p>

    <h4>prepare a text file containing your preferred ascii art </h4>
    <p>like shown here:</p>
    <img src="./show3.png" alt="">
    <p>after you've done that, go into your home folder and mark "show hidden files"
        then, you will find the config folder and inside it the neofetch folder

    </p>
    <h4>i.e:</h4>
    <img src="./show1.png" alt="">
    <p>inside, you will find a config file which you will want to double click
        and you will see all the info you can find in your actual neofetch but in code. 
    </p>

    <p>find the part where it says this:</p>

    <img src="./show2.png" alt="">
    <p>and replace the "default" and "image source" from auto this what you see in the picture above

    </p>
    <h3>of course, with your text file location instead of what's written in the picture</h3>

    <p>and you're done!! enjoy your reddit karma and self appreciation! </p>
